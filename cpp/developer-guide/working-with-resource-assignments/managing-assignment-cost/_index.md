## **Managing Assignment Cost**
The [ResourceAssignment ](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/tasks/class/aspose.tasks.resource_assignment/)class exposes several properties used to manage assignment cost:

- Cost represents an assignment's total project cost (decimal).
- Bcwp represents the budgeted cost of work to date on an assignment (double).
- Bcws represents the budgeted cost of work scheduled for an assignment (double).
- Acwp represents the actual cost of the work carried out on an assignment to date (double).

To view assignment costs in Microsoft Project:

1. On the Task Usage page, select the **Insert** menu and then **Column**.
2. Add columns.
