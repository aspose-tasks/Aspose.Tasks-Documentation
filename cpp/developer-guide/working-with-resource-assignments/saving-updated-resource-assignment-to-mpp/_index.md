Aspose.Tasks for C++ API supports updating resource assignment data and writing it back to an MPP file.

## **Updating Resource Assignments**
To read, assign and save the updated file:

1. Read an MPP file. 
   The one used in this example contains one task and one resource without any assignments.
2. Assign the resource to the task.
3. Add the assigned resource to the project.
4. Finally, save the project to the MPP file.

The following code example demonstrates how to perform these tasks.
