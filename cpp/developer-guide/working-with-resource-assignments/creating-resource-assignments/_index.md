Resource assignments are linking tasks and resources. This article explains how to create resource assignments using Aspose.Tasks for C++.

## **Creating Resource Assignments**
The [Resource](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/class/aspose.tasks.resource) class exposes two different ways of creating a resource assignment, either using the default constructor or by passing a task and resource.

**Programming Sample: Default Constructor**
Create a [ResourceAssignment](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/class/aspose.tasks.resource_assignment) instance without requiring any parameters to be passed.

## **Creating Multiple Resource Assignments**
The following code example demonstrates how to set multiple resource assignments for one task and set user-defined start and end date for the resources.
