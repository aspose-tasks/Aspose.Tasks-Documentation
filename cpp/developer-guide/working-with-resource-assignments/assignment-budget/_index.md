## **Assignment Budget**
The [ResourceAssignment](https://apireference.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/class/aspose.tasks.resource_assignment) class exposes a number of properties for working with an assignment's budget:

- BudgetWork represents the budgeted work of resource assignments to date (TimeSpan).

To see assignment budgets in Microsoft Project:

1. On the Task Usage page, select the Insert menu and then Column.
2. Add columns.
