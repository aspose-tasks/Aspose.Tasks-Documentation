## **Overview**
Resources are actually the people included in the project plan but resources can be people, equipment, facilities, funding, or anything required for the completion of a project task. In Microsoft Project, the resources tab provides various features to manage resources for the project. Aspose.Tasks API provides [Rsc](https://apireference.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/class/aspose.tasks.rsc/) class to represent [Resource](https://apireference.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/class/aspose.tasks.resource/)properties. The Resource class allows adding a new resource to the project.
