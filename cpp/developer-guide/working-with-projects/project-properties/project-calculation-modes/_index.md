## **Overview**
Project calculation modes are used to set how the project should calculate project dates, cost and other necessary fields. Aspose.Tasks for C++ API provides three project calculation modes where each mode's output is different based on the selection. These calculation modes are:

- None - Sets only necessary properties and does not perform any calculations
- Manual - Sets only dependent object properties without recalculation of any other data
- Automatic-Recalculates dates, work and cost properties automatically

The code examples given below demonstrates the usage of each of the calculation modes.
