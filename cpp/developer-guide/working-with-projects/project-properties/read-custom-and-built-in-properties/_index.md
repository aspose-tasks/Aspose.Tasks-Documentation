In Aspose.Tasks for C++ the custom properties are available through the typed collection [CustomProjectPropertyCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/class/aspose.tasks.properties.custom_project_property_collection) which is accessible using get_CustomProps given in [Project](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/class/aspose.tasks.project) class whereas the built-in properties are available using get_BuiltInProps representing [BuiltInProjectPropertyCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/tasks/cpp/class/aspose.tasks.properties.built_in_project_property_collection).

The following code example demonstrates how to read built-in properties.
