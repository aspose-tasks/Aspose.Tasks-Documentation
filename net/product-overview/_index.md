Aspose.Tasks for .NET is designed to perform equally well server- or client-side. Aspose.Tasks for .NET is a single .NET assembly that can be deployed with any .NET application by simply copying it. You do not have to worry about other services or modules. You can literally generate thousands of documents in minutes with Aspose.Tasks and that involves opening a document, modifying content and formatting or populating it with data and saving it. 

Aspose.Tasks is developed in a way that only one thread works on a document at a time. It is a typical scenario to have one thread working on one document. Different threads can safely work on different documents at the same time.

## **Declaration**
All Aspose .NET components require Full Trust permission to be set. The reason for this is that Aspose .NET components need to access registry settings, system files other than a virtual directory for certain operations like parsing fonts. Moreover, Aspose .NET Components are based on core .NET system classes that also require Full Trust permission set in many cases.

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such security level applies the following constraints:

- OleDbPermission is not available. This means you cannot use the ADO.NET managed OLE DB data provider to access databases.
- EventLogPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the Windows event log.
- ReflectionPermission is not available. This means you cannot use reflection.
- RegistryPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the registry.
- WebPermission is restricted. This means your application can only communicate with an address or range of addresses that you define in the <trust> element.
- FileIOPermission is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application's virtual directory hierarchy.

For the reasons specified above, Aspose .NET components cannot be used on servers granting permission set other than Full Trust.
