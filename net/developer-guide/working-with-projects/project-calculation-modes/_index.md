## **Project Calculation Modes**
Aspose.Tasks for .NET API provides three project calculation modes which define how values of dependent properties are calculated when the value of a property is set.
These calculation modes are:

- None - Sets only necessary properties and does not perform any calculations
- Manual - Sets only dependent object properties without recalculation of any other data
- Automatic - Recalculates dates, work and cost properties automatically

This examples below shows the usage of each of these with the help of code samples.
