## **Performing Risk Analysis**
Aspose.Tasks for .NET API supports performing risk analysis on a Project data file. This is based on the Monte Carlo simulation that supports different probability distributions and correlations. The Aspose.Tasks.RiskAnalysis.RiskAnalyzer class can be used to perform the risk analysis that is based on a project schedule (task durations and their start/finish dates). So, a project Finish date can be the output of such analysis. The following example illustrates this functionality step-by-step.
