## **Sorting Tasks by Name**
While working with a project using Aspose.Tasks, the tasks in the project can be sorted by any of the fields. This article shows how to implement the IComparable interface to sort tasks by name.

First, define a class that implements the IComparable interface. Then traverse the tasks in the project and sort them by name.
