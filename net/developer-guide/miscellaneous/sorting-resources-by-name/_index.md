## **Sorting Resources**
When working with a project using Aspose.Tasks, project resources can be sorted by any of the fields. This article shows how to implement the IComparable interface to sort resources by name. To accomplish this, first, define a class that implements the IComparable interface as [shown below](/tasks/net/sorting-resources-by-name/). Then traverse the resources in the project and [sort them by name](/tasks/net/sorting-resources-by-name/).
