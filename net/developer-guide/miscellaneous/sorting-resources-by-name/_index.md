## **Sorting Resources**
Aspose.Tasks allows sorting of project resources by any of the fields like name etc. This article shows how to implement the IComparable interface to sort resources by name. To accomplish this, first, define a class that implements the IComparable interface as [shown below](/tasks/net/sorting-resources-by-name/). Then traverse the resources in the project and [sort them by name](/tasks/net/sorting-resources-by-name/).
