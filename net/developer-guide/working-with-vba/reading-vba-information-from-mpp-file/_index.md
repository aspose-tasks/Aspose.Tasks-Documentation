Aspose.Tasks for .NET API provides support for reading VBA information from the MPP file. This includes working with:

- VBA Information
- Modules information contained in the Project
- References Information stored in the Project

The [VBaProject](https://apireference.aspose.com/tasks/net/aspose.tasks/vbaproject) class is the main class for reading the VBA information from the project file. This further has [Modules](https://apireference.aspose.com/tasks/net/aspose.tasks/vbaproject/properties/modules) and [References](https://apireference.aspose.com/tasks/net/aspose.tasks/vbaproject/properties/references) collection for reading further details of the VBA project file. This article demonstrates the usage of all these with the help of code samples.

## **Reading VBA Project Information**
