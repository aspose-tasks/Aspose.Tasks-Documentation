When setting up calendar exceptions with Aspose.Tasks, it is possible to define working days as exceptions.

{{% /alert %}} 
## **Defining Workdays**
The Exceptions collection exposed by the [Calendar](https://apireference.aspose.com/tasks/net/aspose.tasks/calendar) class can be used to define the weekdays for an exception.

To see a list of exceptions in Microsoft Project:

1. Open a file.
2. From the **Tools** menu, select **Change Working Time** to open the Change Working Time dialogue.
### **Programming Samples**
The following example defines the dates 24-Dec-2009 through 31-Dec-2009 as exceptions.
