A project is, essentially, made up by a number of tasks, each of which has to be completed for the project to be completed. When working with project files, adding tasks is an important activity. Tasks are often linked to other tasks, to indicate dependency, and typically have a set duration. Aspose.Tasks let developers create tasks and define, at the time of creation, their name, and children or duration.

The default constructor creates a Task instance without any parameter being passed.
