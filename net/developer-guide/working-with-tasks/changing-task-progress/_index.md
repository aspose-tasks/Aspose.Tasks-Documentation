Aspose.Tasks supports changing a task's progress in terms of its percentage completion through the [Task](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/tasks/aspose.tasks/task) class' SetPercentComplete() method. This method takes an integer argument as input for the percentage work completed.

The following piece of code shows how to change the progress of a task.
