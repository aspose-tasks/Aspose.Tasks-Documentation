Tasks in  a project file may contain embedded documents as its part such as text files or Word documents. Though, Aspose.Tasks doesn't support retrieving such  documents from a task's notes property in totality, it can be used in combination with Aspose.Words to retrieve and save such documents. This article shows how this can be achieved using Aspose.Tasks and Aspose.Words.

You will need [Aspose.Words for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/words/net) to retrieve the documents using NotesRTF property of a task.
