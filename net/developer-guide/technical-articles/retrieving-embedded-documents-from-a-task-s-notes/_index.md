Tasks in  a project file may contain embedded documents as its part such as text files or Word documents. Though, Aspose.Tasks doesn't support retrieving such  documents from a task's notes property in totality, it can be used in combination with Aspose.Words to retrieve and save such documents. This article shows how this can be achieved using Aspose.Tasks and Aspose.Words.
