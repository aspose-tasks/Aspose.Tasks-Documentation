In Microsoft Project's Gantt chart view, tasks' bar styles can be customized by the user to have text displayed around the bars or to have user-defined appearance of Start, Middle and End parts of a bar. Tasks' bar styles can be customized for a specific task or for a group of tasks which meet certain criteria. This can also be achieved using Aspose.Tasks for .NET API using the GanttBarStyle. This article shows how to read and add custom bar styles using Aspose.Tasks.
