Aspose.Tasks for .NET lets you render Gantt chart to multipage TIFFs.
The SaveFileFormat enumeration contains the available output options, including TIFF. The project can be rendered to TIFF with or without compression; supported compression schemes are RLE, CCITT3, CCITT4 and LZW.

## **Rendering to Multipage TIFF**
The following code sample:

1. Reads a project file.
2. Sets the output file format.
3. Applies compression and saves an image to disk.
4. Removes compression and saves an image to disk.
