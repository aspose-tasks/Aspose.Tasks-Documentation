**Changing progress of a Task**
Aspose.Tasks for Java supports changing a task's progress in terms of its percentage completion through the [Task](https://apireference.aspose.com/tasks/java/com.aspose.tasks/Task) class' SetPercentComplete() method. This method takes an integer argument as input for the percentage work completed.

The following piece of code shows how to change the progress of a task.
