**Creating a Resource**
The simplest way of creating and adding a resource is to call the Project class' addResource method. Variants of this method let you:

1. Add a resource with the default constructor
2. Add a named resource
3. Add a resource before some resource

The following code samples show adding resources to a project using each of these methods.
