## **Major Features**
## **Major Features**
We have implemented new Aspose.Tasks API. The API is more clear and 
easy to use. We recommend our customers to start to use the revamped 
version. Note, we will publish at least three releases of the existing 
API along side the new version. Bugs and any regression issues will be 
fixed in both versions but new features will be added in the revamped 
version only. We have supported new features for writing and reading for
mpp format, importing Primavera XML file format and export to HTML 
format. Also moving a task from one parent to other have been 
implemented. Six bugs have been fixed. Please, see list of all features
below.
