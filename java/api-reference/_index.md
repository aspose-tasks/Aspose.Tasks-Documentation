Aspose.Tasks for Java is a class library that enables Java application developers to embed the functionality of processing Microsoft Project ® documents (MPP/MPT/XLS) without even using Microsoft Project®. The API, hence, eliminates the requirement of Microsoft Office Automation in such an application. The component provides an easy to use API for manipulating project files, saving time and money compared to developing similar features from scratch which is written completely in Java.
